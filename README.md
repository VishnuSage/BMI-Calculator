### The challenge

This website was built with the intention of allowing users to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range

I am happy to say, I fulfilled all the requirements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 5.0
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

I learned that javascript, although fun, is stressful. I also learned that bootstrap's rigidity, especially with the grids, has influenced mine and many others' decision to move away from that library and more towards tailwindcss which i will be attempting for future projects (hopefully)


### Continued development

I need to work more on my javascript. From my naming abilities to being able to create a concise code that retains neatness. I wouldn't say that my current code is bad, since it's straightforward and easily understandable, but I can be better.

### Useful resources

- [Static Text Addition to Input Form] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24369197/how-to-add-static-text-inside-an-input-form) - This helped me identify an amazing way to add static texts to input form using the label tag and 'after' pseudo-selector. Highly recommended.
